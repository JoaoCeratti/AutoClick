#  Basic Auto Clicker with PyAutoGUI

A simple Python project that automates mouse clicks with a basic toggle logic! 

## How It Works?

- **Press `A`**: The auto clicker toggles between **ON** and **OFF**. Each time you press `A`, it changes the state. When activated, it clicks at a speed of **10 clicks per second (CPS)**.
- **Press `Q`**: The program stops completely. 

>  **Note**: When you press `A`, the program "waits" until the key is released before toggling.
